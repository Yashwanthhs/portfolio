                    Hi, my name is Yashwanth. I enjoy creating things that live on the internet.
                    I have been developing and designing software since 2018, the period
                    during which I have worked in different environments. <br>
                    Fast-forward to today, I've had the privilege of working on Electric vehicle 
                    charging software at <a class="company" href="https://www.siemens.com/global/en.html" target="_blank">SIEMENS</a>.
                    Here I develop features end to end from design to testing for the different MICRO SERVICE.
                    <br>
                    When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably trekking or busy playing cricket.

                    Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
